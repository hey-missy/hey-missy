## important!!
we have ossd and often are confused with emotions, expressions, and undetones, so **please** be patient!

(People with OSDD experience a disconnection from their thoughts, feelings, or identity. This can include chronic and recurrent syndromes, identity disturbance, acute dissociative reactions, and dissociative trance. For us, we face all these symptoms along with having very faint switches, so were not always sure who and what is  going on)
