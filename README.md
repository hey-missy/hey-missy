## interactions
im almost always off tab whilst on pt, but im always up for c+h! (cuddle and hide)

please dont twerk at me or so those random boops, idk how to react to those T_T

ill sometimes use simple tonetags (tt) scince im terrible at conveying myself online

## important!!
i have ossd and often are confused with emotions, expressions, and basic convo, so **please** be patient!

(People with OSDD experience a disconnection from their thoughts, feelings, or identity. This can include chronic and recurrent syndromes, identity disturbance, acute dissociative reactions, and dissociative trance. For me, i often zone out, grow detatched, and sometimes switch between personalities **not to be confused with alters!!**)

## thanks for reading :3
